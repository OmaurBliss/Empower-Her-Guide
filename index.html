This fruit also contains a healthy dose of potassium (about 400 mg). This is especially important for long-distance runs or in hot temperatures when you are likely to sweat a lot and thus lose valuable minerals. Potassium (as well as other minerals like sodium, magnesium and chloride) compensates for this loss and lowers your blood pressure at the same time.

                                <i class=" icons fas fa-utensils"></i>  Yogurt is the perfect combination of carbohydrates and proteins. It has a value of nearly 85%, meaning that it has a high percentage of essential amino acids (which cannot be synthesized by the body and so must be obtained through food). Consumed right after a walk, run, or workout, it can speed up your recovery and thus protect your muscles. The calcium contained within also strengthens your bones. An additional benefit of yogurt is that it contains live lactic acid bacteria (probiotics). These stimulate your gut flora and thus boost your immune system. This is important for everybody, not just runners.

                                <i class=" icons fas fa-utensils"></i>  It is no coincidence that people often hold pasta parties the night before a marathon. These events not only help put you in the right mindset for the next day’s race, but the high-carb meal also fills up your glycogen stores. Full glycogen reserves provide you with the energy you need during the marathon. When buying pasta, and bread for that matter, make sure to choose the whole-grain variety – these keep you full longer and contain additional B vitamins (like bananas, too). These are essential for building muscle and can improve your endurance and performance. Enjoy your pasta, for instance, with a tuna and tomato sauce instead of the heartier carbonara version. It doesn’t sit as heavy in your stomach but is still full of calories.
